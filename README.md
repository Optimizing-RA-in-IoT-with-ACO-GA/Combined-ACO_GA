# Combined-ACO_GA

## Overview
The Combined ACO-GA repository implements a unified hybrid optimization algorithm that integrates Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimizing resource allocation in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This method focuses on minimizing communication costs and improving resource distribution efficiency.

## Features
- Unified hybrid optimization combining ACO and GA.
- Improved resource allocation strategies for IoT.
- Comprehensive performance evaluation and analysis.
- Python implementation with detailed documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (install using `pip`):
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
