# Combined-ACO_GA

## Overview
The **Combined ACO-GA** method presents an integrated approach where **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** and **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** are merged into a single cohesive algorithm. This innovative strategy simultaneously leverages the unique strengths of both techniques, aiming to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. By combining the pheromone-driven search of ACO with the evolutionary operators of GA, this method delivers more precise and efficient solutions.

## Algorithm Structure
The proposed combined algorithm consists of two main phases:

### 1. ACO-GA Integration Phase
In this phase, the algorithm generates an initial population of solutions using ACO principles. ACO creates paths based on pheromone trails, helping to identify promising areas in the problem space. These paths serve as the initial population for the GA.

### 2. Evolutionary Optimization Phase
In this phase, the paths generated by ACO are refined using GA techniques. Key operations include:
- **Selection**: Choosing the fittest solutions based on defined criteria.
- **Crossover**: Combining segments from different solutions to create new paths.
- **Mutation**: Introducing variability to maintain diversity within the population.

These genetic operations are applied iteratively over several generations, continuously improving the solutions. The integration of ACO's focus on promising search areas with GA's ability to maintain diversity enhances overall algorithm performance, achieving both local and global optimization effectively.

The flowchart of the proposed combined algorithm is illustrated below.

## Pseudocode
The `CombinedACO_GA` class integrates ACO and GA algorithms for solving optimization problems. The process starts by generating an initial population of solutions using the `generate_all_paths` function in ACO, where paths are created based on calculated pheromone levels and probabilities. GA then iteratively refines these solutions using `ga_fitness` to evaluate solutions, `ga_crossover` to combine sections of different solutions, and `ga_mutate` to introduce variability. The final solution is the individual with the highest fitness after several generations of optimization.

The final solution is determined as the individual with the highest fitness after multiple generations of optimization.
